## Augmented Reality Powered Online Retail Solution
### An Android AR Shopping app using ARcore

This is a demo of an Android online shopping app that displays products in AR and also allows to view the 3D model of assets.

The purpose of this project is to realize the future of the digital retail industry.
My vision is that the future of online retail websites will heavily leverage AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality) technologies, to compliment the online shopping experience.
